        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this post, we demonstrate how to use large vision models (LVMs) for semantic video search using natural language and image queries. We introduce some use case-specific methods, such as temporal frame smoothing and clustering, to enhance the video search performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the end-to-end functionality of this approach by using both asynchronous and real-time hosting options on Amazon SageMaker AI to perform video, image, and text processing using publicly available LVMs on the Hugging Face Model Hub. Finally, we use Amazon OpenSearch Serverless with its vector engine for low-latency semantic video search.]]></summary>
