          "description": "3W哪个更重要 人工智能时代，理解事物的 3W（What，How，Why）哪个更重要？最近我一直在思考这个问题。 最初触发我重新思考3W重要性以及在AI时代哪个因素更应该获取我们的关注，是前段时间看的一本书《理解和改变世界》里对3W 的描述。 该书表达在AI时代 What 不是最重要的，What 是对事物的定义和描述，但是这种定义和描述往往带有主观性，比如说情人眼里出西施。唐朝以体形丰腴为美，而现代以婀娜多姿者称为美人。再比如当西游记里的八戒被称为妖怪的时候，在而是观看的孩子眼里就是头可爱的猪而已。 如果说对How的上述表达我还能理解，该书对How 和 Why的重要性解读却让我陷入纠结。 首先他认为 Why 不重要，该书对Why的描述是Why 定义的是动机或者意义，而原因有时候会变。 比如为什么中国80年代要计划生育？为什么现在又放开计划生育？这些问题的答案会随着时代、政策和与当前的社会、人口老龄化的环境，经济背景相的变化而变化。 其次本书认为搞清楚How最重要，强调实践和掌握应用解决方案。 这本书让我深深地Lost了： 当我们人人对概念的本质进行深入思考时，我们的实践仅够学习应用解决方案（How），我们的时间仅够思考“如何”，而没有时间问及“为何”。 真的Why 不再重要了吗？ 当我重新梳理书中关于Why的示例展开来时，我发现有两种为什么(why): 当说为什么迟到，给出的答案是一种理由，这个理由也会变化;当问为什么中国80年代要计划生育时，为什么现在又放开计划生育，给出的答案也会随着时代不同而有所变化。 而当我们问为什么三角形2边之和大于第三边，为什么直角三角形两边平方等于斜边平方时，答案确是可证明。 这两种Why 有什么区别呢？ 当我带着这个问题问了LLM模型 Meta Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Turbo 后，给出的答案让我茅塞顿开。 我终于明白在AI时代，Why 还是最重要。不过这里的Why 指的是本质性为什么。新的时代浪潮下，我希望能够珍惜每一天，更加深入地探求和理解本质性为什么，寻找事物的真谛。",
