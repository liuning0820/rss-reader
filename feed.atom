        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[INRIX pioneered the use of GPS data from connected vehicles for transportation intelligence. In this post, we partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) customer INRIX to demonstrate how Amazon Bedrock can be used to determine the best countermeasures for specific city locations using rich transportation data and how such countermeasures can be automatically visualized in street view images. This approach allows for significant planning acceleration compared to traditional approaches using conceptual drawings.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems consume valuable resources by ingesting and maintaining embeddings for documents that might never be queried, resulting in unnecessary storage costs and reduced system efficiency. This post presents a just-in-time knowledge base solution that reduces unused consumption through intelligent document processing. The solution processes documents only when needed and automatically removes unused resources, so organizations can scale their document repositories without proportionally increasing infrastructure costs.]]></summary>
